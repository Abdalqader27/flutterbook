# TestComponent constructor




    *[<Null safety>](https://dart.dev/null-safety)*


const
TestComponent({[Key](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Key-class.html)? key, required [String](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/String-class.html) s})


<p>I got a string</p>



## Implementation

```dart
const TestComponent({Key? key, required this.s}) : super(key: key);
```
